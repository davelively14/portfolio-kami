Just a guy from Atlanta seeking to turn my passion into a career. I'm currently enrolled in Bloc's [Software Development Track](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track) and have completed my [capstone project](http://www.resurgens.io/portfolio/1_flatfoot/) for the web development portion of my training.

My path to software engineering is a bit abnormal. I graduated from West Point in 2004 with a BS in History and a minor in Computer Science. After spending 7.5 years as an Cavalry officer, I transitioned to civilian life as a recruiter. I've spent the last 5+ years managing teams of recruiters at two different agencies in the Atlanta area. While I've enjoyed success both in the Army and as a recruiting manager, they aren't my passion.

On October 5, 2015, I committed to make a career transition to my true passion: software engineering. All that eventually led to me Bloc.
