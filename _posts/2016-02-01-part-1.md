title: "Journey into Night"

## In the Beginning...

I liken my learn-on-my-own, pre-[Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/) attempts at transitioning to a career as a software developer to Eugene O'Neill's _Long Day's Journey into Night_. Much is said, much is learned, and much alcohol is consumed, but by the end of the play we're no closer to a resolution than when the curtain first rose.

I've always had an affinity towards programming. My father, a successful electrical engineer for GE, had access to cutting edge technology - like a [286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) with a 40mb HDD, 1012kb of RAM, MS-DOS, 5 1/4" floppy, high tech 3.5" floppy, [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic), and the [DOS version](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Where_in_the_World_is_Carmen_Sandiego_1985) of _Where in the World is Carmen Sandiago_. In high school, I learned the basics of [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and took AP computer science with the ever powerful [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), where I `WriteLn`'d my way to a college credit.

Speaking of, my [college experience](http://www.usma.edu/) certainly wasn't normal for a variety of reasons, but one of the more interesting aspects is that in addition to required core STEM courses (Computer Science, Calculus I & II, Physics, Chemistry, Physical Geography), every student has to take an "engineering track", which consists of five additional courses in a given discipline. For me, Computer Science was the easy choice.

That was all a great foundation, but a funny thing happened to me on the way to becoming a coder: I got sidetracked by 3 deployments and a post-Army career as a Recruiting Manager at a couple of agencies in Atlanta (hold on to your resumes, folks, unless you're an [HR executive](http://www.lucasgroup.com/executive-recruiting/hr-recruiting/)). By year 3 of recruiting, I knew that wasn't for me long term. The money is great, the people are great, and my bosses have been great - but I'm not passionate about the work. I don't go home at night, fire up LinkedIn, and source a call list for the next day. However, what I did start doing is firing up a text editor and developing code into the wee hours of the night...

## And then there was light...

I started sporadically at first. A lot had changed since the early 2000's. First of all, automated testing was suddenly a thing. Free (aka open source) development software for various languages was not only readily available, but was powerful and used in production. Big fat manuals, however, were a thing of the past. But I loved pulp, so my first trip was to Barnes & Noble for a new book: [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/agile-web-development-with-rails-4-sam-ruby/1124320366/2675783356682?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP20436&k_clickid=3x20436). I didn't stop with books. During my commute by train, I would listen to every podcast I could get my hands on: [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/), [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues), [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/), [Elixir Fountain](https://soundcloud.com/elixirfountain), [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast), and several more.

I was hooked. I knew I found my calling, and on October 5, 2015, I made a promise to myself: I would make a commit each and every day to my GitHub account. Some days that was only a README update, others some documentation or a new test, but regardless of where I was (Italy, Cura√ßao, Napa, Savannah, etc.), I took the time to make some progress towards my goal.

Those podcasts and my own projects led me to seek out different technologies. After Rails, I learned some JavaScript, and after JavaScript I began learning what quickly became my favorite language, [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) was next up. While I continued to learn and grow as a developer, I didn't feel any closer to my goal. I could see the light, but I needed a path to get there.
